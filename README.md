# Pet Classifier

This classifier is a simple example of machine learning made from scratch, from the structure of the ML to the structure of the training and test data. 
The folder structure is simple: inside the training data folder, you need to create subfolders, with the exact names of how ML should classify the images, and likewise with the test data. In the case of this classifier, the structure was as follows: 

*__ Training data folder 
*  |__ Dog folder
      |__ image1
      |__ image2
      |__ ...
*  |__ Cat folder
      |__ image1
      |__ image2
      |__ ...
*  |__ Rabbit folder
      |__ image1
      |__ image2
      |__ ...

Important reminder: the test data folder must have exactly the same structure and the subfolders must be named exactly the same as the training data subfolders. 

Note: This classifier was fed 40 images of each animal for training data, and the test data was 4 images for each animal. The accuracy reached 66.67%, and to increase it, it is necessary to increase the amount of data in the training folders, but this is just an example, and as it was done completely from scratch, it is a time-consuming process.
